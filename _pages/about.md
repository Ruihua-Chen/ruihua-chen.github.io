Greetings! I am currently an undergraduate student started from 2022 at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi’an Jiaotong University [(XJTU)](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by associate Prof. [Bangyu Wu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/bangyuwu/home) and working with Ph.D. student [Yisi Luo](https://yisiluo.github.io/). I will pursue a PhD degree at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi’an Jiaotong University in 2026, supervised by Prof. [Deyu Meng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/dymeng).

My research interests include machine learning theory and PDE-related forward and inversion problems, e.g., implicit regularization, neural tangent kernel (NTK), neural operator, and full-waveform inversion (FWI).
